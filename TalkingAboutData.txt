TALKING ABOUT DATA


1) Categorical:  Bins/Buckets
2) Quantitative -- Numbers can be assigned like height weight length...
    
	Discreet 
	Continuous



TALKING ABOUT HISTOGRAMS
Shape: Bell shaped/Right Skewed/Left Skewed distribution
	   Humps or number of bell curves: Uni-modal distribution. bi-modal distribution	

Center:

     Median : is the venter of the heavily populated postion of the histogram
	    Hint : count the number of bars with reasonable height and distrubute half to each side to get the center
		
			
	 Bell shaped - Mean and median will be the same
	 Left skewed Mean(will be pulled to the left) and so will be less that Median
     Right skewed Mean(will be pulled to the right) and so will be more that Median
 

Range:

Outliers: Yes

InterQuartile range: Q3 - Q1
Standard deviation : Amount above and below that the data varies from the mean
On average, the exam scores are about 14.4 points from the mean exam score.
Correct: The standard deviation is roughly the average distance that the values are from the mean.


Quartiles 25% 50% 75%  Median mean standard deviation Min and Max 




BEll shaped Curve: Emprical Rule


Standard Score: (Actual value - Mean)/Standard Deviation

z-score: How many standard deviations are you from mean

Negative standard score implies that the Observed value is less than mean 
Positive standard score implies that the Observed value is more than mean 

Standard Deviation : 68% values are within one standard deviation, 95% within two and 99.7

Step 3: Find the quartiles.
The first quartile is the median of the data points to the left of the median.

The third quartile is the median of the data points to the right of the median.

Because the type of sandwich ordered is a categorical variable, we can not label the distribution type. 
Would this graph still make sense if we rearranged the bars? Would the shape be the same if we rearranged them?




Some quick tips for assessing how good the data in infographics are:

Look for the source of the information. Are there competing interests?
Check the scale of the data. Many pieces of information can be hidden or exaggerated based on how the scale is generated.
While visualizations can be cute, think about how all dimensions of a graph scale. For example, scaling up the height of an object by two will quadruple the two dimensional volume.
